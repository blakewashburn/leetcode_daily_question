Title: 
739. Daily Temperatures

Description: 
    Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example:
    Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
    Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

    Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
    Output: [1,1,1,0]

    Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
    Output: [1,1,0]

Constraints:
    1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
    30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
